# Goal
This project is a student project at the Munich University of Applied Sciences.
The aim is to build and operate an inverter with an output of 3.6 kW,
which is supplied with 230 volts and can operate a motor in the frequency range of 10 to 500 Hz.
The ESP32-S3 and the SimpleFoc Bilbiotek were used for this.
